h1. oscit: TODO

1. refactor: const correctness (do not return const values: const reference or value)
2. refactor: script.h should use File

h2. Low level stuff

1. Replace '#define' by constants in constants.h
2. THash should resize automatically when content grows.
3. concurrency audit
4. regenerate, compile and test MidiMessage Lua bindings ?

h2. Value audit

Audit Value in regards to concurrent execution. Maybe we need to make "Value" immutable or use copy on
write if the reference count is greater then 1. We could also use a String class (reference counted, immutable
std::string). We could then remove the need for "const char *" and std::string and only use String.

h2. TODO: later

1. Fix IP resolution (ZeroConf code):
   Understand how we can connect to the remote when we have resolved from ZeroConfBrowser
   and adapt Location to store the relative information.
2. RefCount locations (shared objects ?).
