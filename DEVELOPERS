The code written here conforms to http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml. Please follow these guidelines if you want to contribute (you should run misc/cpplint.py without any warning).

== width, height order

Pleae use [width, height] (in this order) for image related dimensions and [row, cols] (in this
order) for matrix related dimensions, even if this is not consistent (x,y vs y,x) but that is how
people are used to see these parameters.

== additions

- Write tests !
- Only accessors/finders that return true or false on success should start with "get_".
- "*" and "&" (pointers and references) should be glued to the variable: const char *str.
- Use "is_" or "has_" for methods without parameters returning true or false ("is_ready()", "has_error()").
- Use the 'virtual' keyword in front of virtual method definitions in sub-classes.
